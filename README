# Euphemus

A JSON parser.  In C.

There are several JSON parsers in C out there already.  Euphemus is
different because it supports schema-assisted parsing: You give it a
JSON schema, and it will generate C source files defining the
corresponding structs, and produce instances of those structs during
parsing.  So code in C can access JSON data almost as easily as code
in a dynamic language.

But Euphemus isn't finished yet.  It only supports a limited subset of
JSON schema for parsing.  And it can't generate JSON, And some
optimization is needed.  And the API is not stable.

Euphemus was the helmsman on the voyage of the Argonauts.
