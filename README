# Euphemus

A JSON parser.  In C.

There are several JSON parsers in C out there already.  Euphemus is a
different because it supports schema-assisted parsing: You give it a
JSON schema, and it will generate C source files defining the
corresponding structures, and produce them during parsing.  So code in
C can access JSON data almost as easily as code in a dynamic language.

However, Euphemus isn't finished yet.  It can parse JSON, but only
supports a limited subset of JSON schema.  And it can't generate JSON,
And some optimization is needed.  And the API is not stable.

Euphemus was the helmsman on the voyage of the Argonauts.
