Speed up string scanning

Fast-path int parsing

Use unaligned loads in expect

Always assume no whitespace, e.g. in struct_parse, array_parse.

Variant dispatch doesn't need to go through metadata.  It can just
call to 2-arg parse funcs.

There is redundancy in the variant dispatch and the initial parse func
dispatch (particularly in number_parse).

Null terminate strings

Rename eu_string string field to chars.

Load a json schema

Codegen from json schema

To json support

Hashing

Check for repeated members

Error codes

Track byte position

string escapes

Optimise scanning whitespace, strings

Optimise: Use contiguous memory for stack frames

Track line, column

UTF-8 support

closed structs.  ignoring open structs.

Fancy allocation strategies.  Intern member names.
